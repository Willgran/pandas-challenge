# When looking at the Top ranking schools based off of "Passing Rate", we can see that charter schools excel over district schools. Charter schools have a 95% overall passing rate as district schools only have 73% overall passing rate. Intrestingly enough, the budget per student does not a direct correlation between passing rates and it matters more on the school size/student count. We can make the assumption that with less students, the budget per student is typically less and the grades have a higher overall passing. Although the scores by grade are shown for display, there doesn't seem to be any major changes from 9th to 12 grade, the averages tend to stay the same for each school. This assignment has taught me how to display csv data in list that are easy to read and communicate tranformations in data sets.
